## The Swan-Canning Estuarine Response Model

This repository houses the hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model for the [Swan Canning estaury](https://parks.dpaw.wa.gov.au/park/swan-canning-riverpark), located in Perth, Western Australia. 

The model uses the TUFLOW-FV finite volume hydrodynamic model, and the AED water quality model.

Various generations of the model system exist and are archived; here the latest SCERM generation is active - SCERM v7.
